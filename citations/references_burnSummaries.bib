	abstract = {Forest managers in North America are attempting to incorporate a growing number of ecological issues across many different temporal and spatial scales. In response, the traditional approach of managing for individual or groups of species and/or functions, is giving way to managing for a more natural time-space array of natural resources. Better known as "landscape management", the strategy relies heavily on understanding the historical, "natural" processes and patterns at the landscape level. The objective of this dissertation is to develop a better understanding of the natural landscape-level dynamics of a fire dominated landscape in northern British Columbia. The age-class distribution was used to show that stand replacing fires had a fire cycle of 80-100 years. Although stands much older than this average persist, there was strong evidence to suggest that very old stands become more susceptible to some form of disturbance. The most striking feature of the age-class distribution was its lack of stability. Although the vast majority of disturbances were very small, and simple in shape, most of the landscape was comprised of very large disturbances. Forest fires were significantly more active in areas with the driest soils. It was also suggested that fire activity may be higher on south and west-facing slopes. Information from the disturbance regime description was incorporated into a spatially explicit landscape model to create multiple landscape scenes of a "natural" disturbance regime. Disturbance size limits and age eligibility restrictions were then imposed in simulation. Generally as size and age restrictions increased, interior forest area decreased, edge density increased, age-class distribution favoured younger forests, spatial diversity increased, and temporal diversity decreased. The detailed results demonstrated the importance of using a variety of pattern metrics, in different forms, to grasp the full impacts of each type and degree of restriction. The two methods of investigating sub-boreal landscape dynamics used in this research demonstrated the dangers of using single landscape "snapshots" to represent "natural" conditions. It also raises important questions with respect to the wisdom of management practices which artificially stabilize both spatial and temporal attributes of landscapes.},

	abstract = {We propose a new model to predict the spatial and temporal behavior of wildfires. Fire spread and intensity were simulated using a cellular automaton model. Monte Carlo techniques were used to provide fire risk probabilities for areas where fuel loadings and topography are known. The model assumes predetermined or measurable environmental variables such as wind direction and magnitude, relative humidity, fuel moisture content, and air temperature. Implementation of the model allows the linking of fire monitoring using remotely sensed data, potentially in real time, to rapid simulations of predicted fire behavior. Calibration of the model is based on thermal infrared remotely sensed imagery of a test burn during 1986 in the San Dimas experimental forest. The model and its various implementations show distinct promise for real-time fire management and fire risk planning.},

	abstract = {Fire activity in North American forests is expected to increase substantially with climate change. This would represent a growing risk to human settlements and industrial infrastructure proximal to forests, and to the forest products industry. We modelled fire size distributions in southern Québec as functions of fire weather and land cover, thus explicitly integrating some of the biotic interactions and feedbacks in a forest-wildfire system. We found that, contrary to expectations, land-cover and not fire weather was the primary driver of fire size in our study region. Fires were highly selective on fuel-type under a wide range of fire weather conditions: specifically, deciduous forest, lakes and to a lesser extent recently burned areas decreased the expected fire size in their vicinity compared to conifer forest. This has large implications for fire risk management in that fuels management could reduce fire risk over the long term. Our results imply, for example, that if 30\% of a conifer-dominated landscape were converted to hardwoods, the probability of a given fire, occurring in that landscape under mean fire weather conditions, exceeding 100,000 ha would be reduced by a factor of 21. A similarly marked but slightly smaller effect size would be expected under extreme fire weather conditions. We attribute the decrease in expected fire size that occurs in recently burned areas to fuel availability limitations on fires spread. Because regenerating burned conifer stands often pass through a deciduous stage, this would also act as a negative biotic feedback whereby the occurrence of fires limits the size of nearby future for some period of time. Our parameter estimates imply that changes in vegetation flammability or fuel availability after fires would tend to counteract shifts in the fire size distribution favoring larger fires that are expected under climate warming. Ecological forecasts from models neglecting these feedbacks may markedly overestimate the consequences of climate warming on fire activity, and could be misleading. Assessments of vulnerability to climate change, and subsequent adaptation strategies, are directly dependent on integrated ecological forecasts. Thus, we stress the need to explicitly incorporate land-cover's direct effects and feedbacks in simulation models of coupled climate–fire–fuels systems.},
